## Purpose

Le Hub is a project I created to enable people to see all the dev work I've done in one single place.
It'll be composed of a carousel showing the latest news related to all my projects.
You'll find cards telling you the mainline of each projects, you'll be able to click them to access each website.
There will also be a carousel feed which will show the latest news in terms of dev technologies so I always stay aware of newer trends.
Finally, you'll find several useful redirect links in the footer: a way to send me an email, access my LinkedIn and GitHub profiles.

To make it simple: **it'll serve as a dashboard for anyone who wants to see what I've achieved as a developer and access my work.**

## Technologies

- **Bootstrap4** \* _for an quick and easy setup._ \*

**Please note that:**
**I may need to use JS in the future to implement some functionalities**, \* _but for now, we're only creating the V1.0 of Le Hub so we'll see that later !_ \*
